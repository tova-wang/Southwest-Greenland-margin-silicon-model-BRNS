# Southwest-Greenland-margin-silicon-model-BRNS
The code and output files from Biogeochemical Reaction Network Simulator (BRNS) for the manuscript "Benthic silicon cycling from fjords to the adjacent continental region: a case study on the Southwest Greenland margin" by T. Wang, H. C. Ng, F. S. Freitas, S. Arndt, and K. R. Hendry.

Steady state site specific model code, Maple scripts, and output files are applied for three coastal sites (MGA3, MGA4, and MGA6) and two fjord sites (AM10a and GF-inlet). Research data utilized to fit the model is accessible at: https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.961726.

This study is funded by the UK Royal Society Enhancement Award (RGF\EA\181036) and European Research Council project ICY-LAB (grant agreement: 678371).
